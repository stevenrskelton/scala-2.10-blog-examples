This is a cumulative project for all blog entry scala classes.
Compiled with Scala 2.10

## Blog Classes

The classes in the global package are worked through and explained in blog posts,
and are not meant to be finished code.  They routinely contain less-optimal code  
to make them concise and easier to explain to the reader.

## Unit Tests

Also included are unit tests, which aren't normally part of the blog entries.
